'''
Shows the occurrences of a solar eclipse in the 21st century.

Works by iterating every five minutes in the 21st century and calculating
if the separation between the Moon and the Sun is less than half of max sun
angular size + half of max moon angular size + half of earth angular size
seen from the moon: "(1952 arcseconds + 2046 arcseconds)/ 2 + (12742 / 3474)
* 2046 arcseconds / 2  in degrees"

The number is hardcoded for simplicity, for more accuracy, it
should be computed from the distance of the Moon and the Sun.
